					OpenFlightGPS is an <a href='https://github.com/rogerleuthner/OpenFlightGPS'>
					open source Android application</a>developed to allow offline
					georeferenced viewing of
					various FAA products. The products are
					minimally processed in order to work with
					OpenFlightGPS. Therefore,
					the maps are NOT OFFICIAL INFORMATION SOURCES. ALWAYS consult
					official sources for aeronautical decision making. OPENFLIGHTGPS is NOT
					INTENDED for inflight
					navigation use; your use of OpenFlightGPS
					constitutes acceptance of these terms.

				<h1>About and Limitations</h1>
				<p>Most phone GPS chips, and many tablet GPS chips, are not very
					accurate and may take a long
					time and a clear sky to get a GPS 'fix'.
					So-called aGPS (GPS assisted by
					cell tower position) may not
					be
					available in your location, or if you are operating without cell
					service, so OpenFlightGPS may seem
					to perform more poorly than other
					GPS applications. This would be
					soley a function of the hardware GPS,
					and not the OpenFlightGPS software.
				</p>
				<p>
					OpenFlightGPS works on Android-powered devices, including cell
					phones and most
					tablets. We suggest that
					maps only be downloaded when
					the user is connected to the internet via
					WIFI, but 3G can be used
					in
					a pinch, as the individual maps are between 2 megabytes all the way
					to almost 20 megabytes, depending
					upon the particular product (such
					as Low Enroute, Sectional, WAC). Users
					may download individual
					maps as
					per the terms of their licensed version. The maker of
					OpenFlightGPS
					is NOT responsible for
					data charges you may incur from your cellular
					provider in downloading
					maps.
					If you wish to purchase maps on a CD,
					please contact us for minimal
					fee products we will send
					you.
				</p>
				<p>
					OpenFlightGPS is developed on the open source Android system
					because we
					believe that vendor-lock-in endemic to some other
					solutions is not in the
					best
					interests of pilots. The FAA provides the
					digital base products for FREE, so
					we believe
					in repackaging and
					selling these products for very low cost.
				</p>

				<p>You may notice some geographical distortion on various maps.
					This is due to the projection
					of the worlds (spherical) surface onto
					a flat map. This distortion is
					not seen on the printed paper
					copies
					because the paper copies do not preserve the georeferencing
					information that is encoded in the
					digital product as distributed by
					the FAA. The maps, while being converted
					to tiles, have
					georeference
					information preserved in order to provide the GPS features of
					OpenFlightGPS.

				<h1>Map Navigator GPS Modes</h1>
				<p>
					OpenFlightGPS can show ownship position oriented in the direction
					of GPS
					movement, and gradually
					scroll the map to keep the ownship
					centered in the the view (moving map).
					Another option is to have the
					ownship
					display coupled to the 'compass' mode, so that the ownship
					will point in
					the direction on the map that the
					Android device itself
					is pointed.
				</p>
				<p>
					OpenFlightGPS also displays a scale in the upper left corner of
					the screen in
					order to allow the user to estimate
					distances at any
					map zoom level. To the right side of the scale, the GPS
					coordinates
					in Latitude, Longitude and
					altitude (feet) appear when the unit has
					a GPS lock (coordinates will not
					display without GPS lock).
				</p>
				<p>
					When the hardware gets a GPS lock, the ownship will automatically
					appear with a 'centerline' extended showing
					the GPS-computed
					heading, or the compass heading depending upon the
					mode selected
					(see below). If there is no
					GPS lock, the ownship will not appear.
					If not in compass mode, and a
					GPS lock is obtained but no motion is
					detected,
					the ownship will change to a 'house' icon.
				</p>

				<section >
					<h3>Compass/GPS Mode</h3>
					<p>
						Compass appears in upper left corner.
						After GPS acquires
						position: ownship 'aircraft' icon appears at your
						location and
						points in direction on the map that device is
						pointed.
						Position and
						altitude coordinates appear in the center or upper right hand
						corner.
					</p>

					<p>
						"Reset Map" will center ownship in display.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section >
					<h3>GPS (no compass) Mode</h3>
					<p>
						Compass does not appear. After GPS acquires position:
						if motion
						is detected by the GPS, ownship 'aircraft' icon
						appears at your
						current location and points in the direction
						on the map of the
						motion. If no motion is detected, ownship
						will change to a 'house'
						at your current location.
						Position and altitude coordinates appear
						in the upper right hand corner.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Reset Map" will center ownship in display.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section >
					<h3>GPS Off</h3>
					<p>
						Neither compass, ownship nor position and altitude coordinates
						will
						appear on
						the screen.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Reset Map" will position the map at the approximate center of
						the
						physical map that is currently open.
					</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id='chooser' class='page'>
				<h1>Chart Chooser</h1>
				<p>
					When OpenFlightGPS is started up, you will be presented with a
					Chart
					Chooser of your "home map".
					This is a user selectable home map.
					As shipped, the "VFR Sectional"
					chooser is set as the home map.
					Change the home map by selecting the Android "menu" key, selecting
					the
					"Preferences" tab, and going to
					"Home Map". Select the home map
					that you want to come up by default;
					close the preferences by using
					the device backbutton.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can change the current Chart Chooser at any time by selecting
					the
					Android "menu" key, then
					selecting "Products" item, and then
					choosing the Chart Chooser you want.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use a Chart Chooser by finger-pressing on the area chart you wish
					to
					view - the charts that are available
					(have been previously
					downloaded to your device) are
					outlined in green, and will flash red
					when selected. When you release the
					press, you may be presented
					with
					a context menu that allows a subselection, for example for "North"
					or "South" of the area.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Chart Chooser presents a geographic area (United States) with
					"hot" areas that correspond to
					charts available for that area. Each
					of the chart sections (such as VFR
					sectional 'Albuquerque')
					appear as
					either a red 'X', a green slash ('/'), or a green outline. The
					red
					'X' means neither of the
					portions (in this case, 'North' and
					'South') are currently downloaded on
					your device. A green slash '/'
					means that one of the portions (either 'North' or 'South') are
					present
					on your device. A green outline
					means the both portions are
					currently on your device.
				</p>
				<p>
					Either way, finger press the 'X', '/' or outline and you will be
					presented with a 'North'/'South' dialog.
					Choose which chart you are
					interested in and if the chart is not on the
					device you will be
					prompted to
					download it; otherwise, the Map Navigator will come up
					with your map in the
					center. If you do download
					a chart, the Chart
					Chooser will automatically update it's symbol
					('X', '/', outline).
				</p>
				<p>
					You can cancel a selection by sliding your finger (before lifting
					your
					finger from the device screen)
					to a non-outlined area on the
					Chart Chooser and then lifting your
					finger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Downloaded maps will persist until you delete them or overwrite
					them with a
					new version. They will persist
					through uninstall of the
					program. If you wish to manually delete the maps,
					first find out the
					location on
					your device by going to the Android 'menu' key and
					selecting the
					'Preferences' menu item. The preferences item
					'Data
					Directory' is the file path on your device to the charts. Each
					distinct chart is contained within a '.zip'
					file found in the data
					directory. You may use a file manager
					application to delete or move
					the zip files.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id='messages' class='page'>
				<h1>Message Display</h1>
				<p>
					The Message Display will show your currently selected map in the
					Android Notification Bar at the top
					of the screen, or "Cancelling
					..." if you cancel your selection.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id='navigator' class='page'>
				<h1>Map Navigator</h1>
				<p>
					The Map Navigator is scrolled simply by sliding your finger on
					the map. You may zoom the map
					either by using a two-finger "pinch"
					or "expand" gesture, or you may use
					the zoom buttons that appear at
					the bottom of the screen when you touch the map.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you find that you have "lost" your map by scrolling it off the
					view, you may recenter the map by
					opening the Android menu items
					(press Android menu key, menu items appear
					on the bottom of the
					screen)
					called 'Reset View' that will perform the same (approximate)
					recenter of
					the map in the view.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Map Navigator will display your current position ("ownship")
					as
					either a miniature airplane or as
					a 'house' symbol, depending upon
					your movement and the settings (see
					preferences section below). The
					Map
					Navigator may also display a scale bar, a magnetic compass face,
					and your
					location in Latitude/Longitude and Altitude,
					again depending
					upon the preferences you have set.

								Screen on in flight - keep the screen from timing out. Note
								that you
								can burn significant battery by
								keeping the screen on too
								long. OpenFlightGPS will remain at the point

				<h1>Updating Charts</h1>
				<section>
					<h3>Over the air (OTA/WIFI)</h3>
					<p>
						Download maps by first connecting your Android device to a WIFI
						network -
						the maps are large, and
						distributing them OTA would be very
						time consuming - although it will work in a
						pinch. After you
						have
						connected your device to your wifi network, open the OpenFlightGPS
						application as you normally
						would, go to your desired Chart Chooser,
						and select the chart that you
						want to download. If the chart
						is found
						to be non-existant or out-of-date on your device, you will
						be
						presented with a screen that
						will allow you to download the map. You
						may open other applications on
						your phone while the download
						is
						proceeding, but don't "backbutton" out of OpenFlightGPS or the
						download will be cancelled.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may force the redownload of a map that the device thinks you
						already have by going to that map,
						selecting the Android 'menu'
						button, then choosing the 'Force Download' menu
						item.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section >
					<h3>Manually download and install</h3>
					<p>
						If you know your way around your device, you may download the
						maps
						manually, and install them
						on your device. Contact us at
						'openflightmap&#60;at&#62;gmail.com' if
						you would like to purchase
						entire map sets either on DVD/CD or Micro-SD.
