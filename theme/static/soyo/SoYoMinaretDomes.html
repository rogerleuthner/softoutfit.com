<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>Approach: Use Shuteye Pass trail (45 min). It is best to approach the 
    climbs described by rappelling from the top of Fallen Eagle Dome (3 X45m). 
    Follow the trail until you can traverse across the top of the Dome. Walk 
    down (SE) and spot a big single pine tree above a curving slab. Rappel from 
    the tree to anchors. Two more rappels down to a ledge just above the creek 
    (anchors with 2 bolts). Watch for sunbathing rattlesnakes.<BR><BR><B>Welcome 
    to Fallen Eagle Dome</B> 5.10a ** Camalot #2 recommended. FA: Elaine 
    Cocuzzo, Thomas Hartmann (Memorial Day, '92).<BR><B>Big brother</B> 5.9 ** 
    Small camming devices to 2 inches required. This climb starts at the very 
    right end of Snake Ledge. This is a serious, traditional climb! FA: Elaine

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>Approach: 45 min. from road. Steep uphill; light bushwhacking close to 
    the rock.<BR><BR>Descent: Rappel Breast Feather (two 45m rappels from 
    trees). If you didn't bring two ropes, or if you feel like hiking, aim S 
    through open talus and around Minerva Dome (40 min.).<BR><BR><B>Sinners and 
    Saints</B> 5.9+ ** Bring two 50m ropes (to avoid rope drag) and a full rack, 
    including a Camalot #4. FA: Felix Gropp, Roger Leuthner, Thomas Hartmann 
    (10/11/92).<BR><B>Massively Parallel</B> 5.10d *** Quickdraws only. A second 
    pitch is in progress! R of Sinners...FA: Felix Gropp, Thomas Hartmann 
    (9/20/93). FFA: Roger Leuthner, Stephen Ruoss.<BR><B>Greed, Envy, Gluttony, 
    Sloth, Lust, Pride, Wrath</B> 5.10a *** Camalot #2, small nuts, slings and 
    quickdraws. Smae start as Massively Parallel. After the first bolt, aim 
    right to a shallow dihedral and a golden streak of knobs. Belay in a small 
    alcove. A second pitch was bolted by anonymous sinners. FA: Elaine Cucuzzo, 
    Thomas Hartmann (9/96).<BR><B>Fat Lady's Bypass</B> 5.9 * FA Marcia Paik,

<H3><A name=bastion></A>The Bastion</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>Approach (A) from Shuteye Peak Road: If you don't have a high-clearance 
    car, park just below Little Shuteye Pass; otherwise, continue as far as you 
    can. After the gate at Little Shuteye Pass, the road gets very rough -- 
    serious 4WD terrain. After you park, cut across through open terrain to the 
    notch and scramble down to base of the S face. (B) It is also possible to 
    approach the Bastion from Shuteye Pass or Minaret Road.

    <P><B>Unknown</B> 5.9 Two pitches, 3 bolts, single-bolt belay. Slings to tie 
    off knobs and a few camming devices are helpful. This hand crack is found in 
    the middle of the S face. The crux is getting to the crack -- then it's fun 
    knob climbing. </P></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A name=fuller></A>Fuller Buttes<BR>East Fuller Butte, E face</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>Approach: From Minaret Road take the Hell's Half Acre turnout and follow 
    the dirt road downhill for about half a mile. Hike on a logging road until 
    you reach a clearing. Follow disappearing trail S619A until you see the 
    Buttes. Hike along the open ridge and scramble down the east face of the 
    East Butte. Stay close to the wall. You may encounter wet slabs early in the 
    season (45 min.).<BR><BR><B>Unnamed</B> 5.8 One pitch. Full rack. FA: 
    Jimothy Fahrni, Thomas Hartmann (94). </UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <UL><A 
    href="SYapproach.html#anchor130365">Approach</A>: 
    (A)When Jackass Creek is difficult to cross, use the approach for East 
    Fuller Buttes. Once you reach the open ridge leading to the top of the 
    Buttes, scramble down the west face of the West Butte. Stay close to the 
    wall -- even then, you will encounter some vicious manzanita. Once you reach 
    the base, the bushwhack is over. The climbs are a few hundred feet up and to 
    the right. (B) Later in the season, a shorter and more enjoyable approach 
    starts at the Jackass Organization Camp. Just before you reach Jackass Rock, 
    take a right turn at the sign for the camp. Follow the dirt road a short 
    distance until it is blocked. Hike along the dirt road for about a mile 
    until you can see the west side of the Butte. Aim for the southern end of 
    the wall. Go down a steep hillside, cross the creek and go straight up to 
    the base of the face (30 min.). (C) The quickest approach is from Road 6S22, 
    the road to Little Jackass Campground. If you find the right approach, it's 
    a 15 min. hike.<BR><BR>Descent: Two 50 m ropes are required for 
    rappels.<BR><BR><B>Yang</B> 5.10b ** Quickdraws only. FA: Elaine Cocuzzo,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>Approach: Park anywhere close to the youth camp sign. Follow faint 
    trails to the base. A couple of fine face climbs are found on the E face of 
    this roadside attraction. A couple of new climbs are found to the left of 
    Vicious.<BR><BR><B>Star Thrower</B> 5.9 * One pitch, 5 slings.<BR><B>Razor
