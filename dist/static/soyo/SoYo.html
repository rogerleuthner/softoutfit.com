  <h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dd>This is the electronic version of the Southern Yosemite Climbing
Guide, Supplement 1. The guide contains information about climbs in the
Southern Yosemite area which were not included in the first edition of
Mark and Shirley Spencer's guidebook (Southern Yosemite Rock Climbs,
Condor Designs, 1988). Southern Yosemite is close to Yosemite Valley,
sporting some big walls and numerous fine domes. Despite several
articles in climbing magazines and the guidebook mentioned above, this
place is rarely visited by more than a handful climbers a year. The
campers, boaters and hunters know about its beauty. Southern Yosemite
is not hip and it is not the intention of this little guide to change
that. But if you are an adventureous soul who wants to get away from
the scene once in a while, this is a great place to visit.
    <h3>Location</h3>
  </dd>
  <dd>South of Yosemite National Park -- what a surprise. This <a
 href="SYroadmap.html">[aaaaahh, file lost in time .....]road map</a>
provides a general overview of the directions described here. The two
main roads that provide access to the climbing areas are Minaret Road
and Beasore. Minaret Road is the better of the two; it provides good
access to most of the domes. Minaret Road leads to North Fork. It runs
high above the San Joaquin River and eventually joins Beasore, forming
a a loop leading back to Bass Lake. Beasore is a good approach choice
if you want to climb in the Shuteye Ridge area. Seasonal snow, creek
crossings and a rough surface serve to complete the backcountry
experience.
    <h3><a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/ca/state.html">Weather
forecast</a> / Road conditions</h3>
  </dd>
  <dd>For up to date information call the Minaret Ranger station at
(209) 877-2218.
    <h3>Climbing season</h3>
  </dd>
  <dd>The climbing season in Southern Yosemite depends on snow and
corresponding road closures. Roads may be impassable after the first
winter storm, usually in December, and usually remain closed until
March/April. Minaret Road opens much earlier than Beasore due to its
southern exposure. Until May, streams may be difficult to cross, and
snow may be present at higher elevations. In general, the best climbing
is from late summer through fall. Wear a loud shirt during hunting
season or you may end up as a prize trophy.
    <h3>Gas, Food, Lodging</h3>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>Gas, food and odd things </b>may be available at Jones Store
and at the Mammoth Pool Campground. Plan ahead -- both have limited
hours! If you are in the mood for some fine dining, you may want to
wait for our Hinterland Dining Guide, coming out soon.
    <p><br>
    <b>Camping</b> is currently free at Soda Springs campground,
Bowlers Campground, and in the National Forest. Fees are collected in
BLM campgrounds ($12/night). There are plans to install hot showers in
some of the campgrounds. Where will it end? </p>
    <p><b>Water</b>: In the majority of the campgrounds, no potable
water is available. Water from streams should be boiled or purified --
giardia is present in the area. </p>
