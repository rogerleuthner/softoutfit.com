				Do not reveal personal information inadvertently. </B></FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>You may
				be &quot;shedding&quot; personal details, including e-mail
				addresses and other contact information, without even knowing it
				unless you properly configure your Web browser. In your browser's
				&quot;Setup&quot;, &quot;Options&quot; or &quot;Preferences&quot;
				menus, you may wish to use a pseudonym instead of your real name,
				and not enter an e-mail address, nor provide other personally
				identifiable information that you don't wish to share. When
				visiting a site you trust you can choose to give them your info,
				in forms on their site; there is no need for your browser to
				potentially make this information available to all comers. Also
				be on the lookout for system-wide &quot;Internet defaults&quot;
				programs on your computer (some examples include Window's
				Internet Control Panel, and MacOS's Configuration Manager, and
				the third-party Mac utility named Internet Config). While they
				are useful for various things, like keeping multiple Web browers
				and other Internet tools consistent in how the treat downloaded
				files and such, they should probably also be anonymized just like
				your browser itself, if they contain any fields for personal
				information. Households with children may have an additional
				&quot;security problem&quot; - have you set clear rules for your
				kids, so that they know not to reveal personal information unless
				you OK it on a site-by-site basis? </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>2)
				Turn on cookie notices in your Web browser, and/or use cookie
				management software or infomediaries.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Cookies&quot;
				are tidbits of information that Web sites store on your computer,
				temporarily or more-or-less permanently. In many cases cookies
				are useful and inocuous. They may be passwords and user IDs, so
				that you do not have to keep retyping them every time you load a
				new page at the site that issued the cookie. Other cookies
				however, can be used for &quot;data mining&quot; purposes, to
				track your motions through a Web site, the time you spend there,
				what links you click on and other details that the company wants
				to record, usually for marketing purposes. Most cookies can only
				be read by the party that created them. However, some companies
				that manage online banner advertising are, in essence, cookie
				sharing rings. They can track which pages you load, which ads you
				click on, etc., and share this information with all of their
				client Web sites (who may number in the hundreds, even
				thousands.) It is unknown whether all of these cookie rings (some
				examples of which are DoubleClick and Link Exchange) do in fact
				share user data, but they certainly can do so potentially.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Browsers
				are starting to allow user control over cookies. Netscape, for
				example, allows you to see a notice when a site tries to write a
				cookie file to your hard drive, and gives you some information
				about it, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. (Be
				on the lookout for cookies the function of which is not apparent,
				which go to other sites than the one you are trying to load, or
				which are not temporary). It also allows you to automatically
				block all cookies that are being sent to third parties (or to
				block all cookies, entirely, but this will make some sites
				inoperable). Internet Explorer has a cookie management interface
				in addition to Netscape-like features, allowing you to
				selectively enable or disable cookies on a site-by-site basis,
				even to allow cookies for a site generally, but delete a specific
				cookie you are suspicious about. With Internet Explorer you can
				also turn on cookies for a site temporarily then disable them
				when you no longer need them (e.g., at an online bookstore that
				requires cookies to process an order, but whom you don't want to
				track what books you are looking at, what links you are
				following, etc., the rest of the time.) Turning on cookie
				warnings will cause alert boxes to pop up, but after some
				practice you may learn to hit &quot;Decline&quot; so fast that
				you hardly notice them any more. The idea is to only enable
				cookies on sites that require them AND whom you trust. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>You can
				also use cookie management software and services. One example is
				the Internet Junkbuster Proxy
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html">http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html</A>&nbsp;).
				It runs on Win95/98/NT and Unix (no Mac version), and can
				selectively block cookies for you (and banner ads, to boot).
				interMute (&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.intermute.com/">http://www.intermute.com/</A>&nbsp;)
				does likewise (and more - blocks popup windows, etc.; only runs
				under Windows). A Java-based solution called Muffin
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://muffin.doit.org/">http://muffin.doit.org/</A>&nbsp;)
				is also available. While it will run on Mac, Win and Unix
				systems, it is definitely for &quot;power users&quot;, as it is
				complicated to set up and operate effectively. There are also
				numerous &quot;cookie eater&quot; applications, some which run on
				a schedule or in the background, that delete cookie files for
				you. As with turning off cookies entirely, you may have trouble
				accessing sites that require certain cookies (though in most
				cases the worst that will happen is that you'll have to re-enter
				a login ID and password you thought were saved.) &quot;Eating&quot;
				the cookies periodically still permits sites to track what you're
				doing for a short time (i.e., the time between successive
				deletion of your cookie file), but thwarts attempts to discern
				and record your actions over time.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yet
				another option is to use an &quot;infomediary&quot; (some are
				home-use software products, others may be network-based
				services), such as SeigeSoft's SiegeSurfer
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.siegesoft.com/_html/tutorial.asp">http://www.siegesoft.com/_html/tutorial.asp</A>&nbsp;),
				Zero Knowledge Systems' Freedom (&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.freedom.net/">http://www.freedom.net</A>&nbsp;),
				among others. These products/services act as a proxy or shield
				between you and sites you visit, and can completely disguise to
				Web sites where you are coming from and who you are (and
				intercept all cookies). Most are Windows-only at this point,
				though Anonymizer
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/affiliate/door.cgi?CMid=13763">http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/affiliate/door.cgi?CMid=13763</A>&nbsp;)
				and (&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.safeweb.com/">http://www.safeweb.com</A>&nbsp;)
				also offer such services that are Web-based and not
				platform-dependent.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
				best solution doesn't exist yet: Full cookie management abilities
				built into the browsers themselves. Only increased user pressure
				on Microsoft, Netscape and other browser makers can make this
				happen. Users should ultimately be able to reject cookies on a
				whole-domain basis, reject all third-party cookies by default,
				reject all cookies that are not essential for the transaction at
				hand, receive notice of exactly what a cookie is intended for,
				and be able to set default behaviors and permissions rather than
				have to interact with cookies on a page-by-page basis. This just
				isn't possible yet. You may wish to contact the company that
				makes your browser software and demand these essential features
				in the next version.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>3)
				Keep a &quot;clean&quot; e-mail address.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>When
				mailing to unknown parties; posting to newsgroups, mailing lists,
				chat rooms and other public spaces on the Net; or publishing a
				Web page that mentions your e-mail address, it is best to do this
				from a &quot;side&quot; account, some pseudonymous or simply
				alternate address, and to use your main or preferred address only
				on small, members-only lists and with known, trusted individuals.
				Addresses that are posted (even as part of message headers) in
				public spaces can be easily discovered by spammers (online junk
				mailers) and added to their list of targets. If your public
				&quot;throw away&quot; address gets spammed enough to become
				annoying, you can simply kill it off, and start a new one. Your
				friends, boss, etc., will still know your &quot;real&quot;
				address. You can use a free (advertising-supported) e-mail
				service provider like Yahoo Mail or Hotmail for such &quot;side&quot;
				accounts. It is best to use a &quot;real&quot; Internet service
				provider for your main account, and to examine their privacy
				policies and terms of service, as some &quot;freemail&quot;
				services may have poor privacy track records. You may find it
				works best to use an e-mail package that allows mulitiple user
				IDs and addresses (a.k.a. &quot;personalities&quot;, &quot;aliases&quot;)
				so that you do not have to switch between multiple programs to
				manange and use more than one e-mail address.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>4)
				Don't reveal personal details to strangers or just-met &quot;friends&quot;.</B>
				</FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
				speed of Internet communication is often mirror in rapid online
				acquaintanceships and friendships. But it is important to realize
				that you don't really know who these people are or what they are
				like in real life. A thousand miles away, you don't have
				friends-of-friends or other references about this person. Be also
				wary of face-to-face meetings. If you and your new e-friend wish
				to meet in person, do it in a public place. Bringing a friend
				along can also be a good idea. One needn't be paranoid, but one
				should not be an easy mark, either. Some personal information you
				might wish to withhold until you know someone much better would
				include your full name, place of employment, phone number, and
				street address (among more obvious things like credit card
				numbers, etc.) Needless to say, such information should not be
				put on personal home pages. (If you have a work home page, it may
				well have work contact information on it, but you needn't reveal
				this page to everyone you meet in a chat room.) For this and
				other reasons, many people maintain two personal home pages, a
				work-related one, and an &quot;off duty&quot; version. In the
				commercial sector, too, beware &quot;fast-met friends&quot;. A
				common &quot;social engineering&quot; form of industrial
				espionage is to befriend someone online just long enough to get
				them to reveal insider information.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>5)
				Realize you may be monitored at work, avoid sending highly
				personal e-mail to mailing lists, and keep sensitive files on
				your home computer.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In most
				US states and many if not most countries, employees have little
				if any privacy protection from monitoring by employers. When
				discussing sensitive matters in e-mail or other online media, be
				certain who you are talking to. If you replied to a mailing list
				post, check the headers - is your reply going to the person you
				think it is, or to the whole list? Also be aware that an
				increasing number of employers are monitoring and recording
				employee Web usage, as well as e-mail. This could compromise home
				banking passwords and other sensitive information. Keep private
				data and private Net usage private, at home. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>6)
				Beware sites that offer some sort of reward or prize in exchange
				for your contact or other information.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>There's
				a very high probability that they are gathering this information
				for direct marketing purposes. In many cases your name and
				address are worth much more to them because they can sell it to
				other marketers (who can do the same in turn...) than what you
				are (supposedly) getting from them. Be especially wary of
				sweepstakes and contests. You probably won't win, but the
				marketer sure will if you give them your information. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>7)
				Do not reply to spammers, for any reason.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Spam&quot;,
				or unsolicited bulk e-mail, is something you are probably already
				familiar with (and tired of). If you get a spammed advertisment,
				certainly don't take the sender up on whatever offer they are
				making, but also don't bother replying with &quot;REMOVE&quot; in
				the subject line, or whatever (probably bogus) unsubscribe
				instructions you've been given). This simply confirms that your
				address is being read by a real person, and you'll find yourself
				on dozens more spammers' lists in no time. If you open the
				message, watch your outgoing mail queue to make sure that a
				&quot;return receipt&quot; message was not generated to be sent
				back to the spammer automatically. (It is best to queue your mail
				and send manually, rather than send immediately, so that you can
				see what's about to go out before it's actually sent. You should
				also turn off your mailer's automatic honoring of return receipt
				requests, if any.) If you have a good Internet service provider,
				you may be able to forward copies of spam e-mail to the system
				administrators who can route a complaint to the ISP of the
				spammer (or if you know a lot about mail headers and DNS tools,
				you can probably contact these ISPs yourself to complain about
				the spammer.) If you are getting spammed a lot, there are a
				variety of filters and anti-spam services available,

				Be conscious of Web security. </B></FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Never
				submit a credit card number or other highly sensitive personal
				information without first making sure your connection is secure
				(encrypted). In Netscape, look for an closed lock (Windows) or
				unbroken key (Mac) icon at the bottom of the browser window. In
				Internet Explorer, look for a closed lock icon at the bottom
				(Windows) or near the top (Mac) of the browser window. In any
				browser, look at the URL (Web address) line - a secure connection
				will begin &quot;https://&quot; intead of &quot;http://&quot;. If
				you are at page that asks for such information but shows
				&quot;http://&quot; try adding the &quot;s&quot; yourself and
				hitting enter to reload the page (for Netscape or IE; in another
				browser, use whatever method is required by your browser to
				reload the page at the new URL). If you get an error message that
				the page or site does not exist, this probably means that the
				company is so clueless - and careless with your information and
				your money - that they don't even have Web security. Take your
				business elsewhere. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>9)
				Be conscious of home computer security.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>On the
				other side of the coin, your own computer may be a trouble spot
				for Internet security. If you have a DSL line or other connection
				to the Internet that is up and running 24 hours, unlike a
				modem-and-phone-line connection, be sure to turn your computer
				off when you are not using it. Most home PCs have pitifully poor
				security compared to the Unix workstations that power most
				commercial Web sites. System crackers search for vulnerable,
				unattended DSL-connected home computers, and can invade them with
				surprising ease, rifiling through files looking for credit card
				numbers or other sensitive data, or even &quot;taking over&quot;
				the computer and quietly using it for their own purposes, such as
				lauching attacks on other computers elsewhere - attacks you could
				initially be blamed for. Firewall hardware and software is
				another option that can protect you from these kinds of attacks
				(available at any computer store; freeware and shareware
				implementations may be available at sites like
				<A HREF="http://www.shareware.com/">http://www.shareware.com/</A>
				or <A HREF="http://www.download.com/">http://www.download.com/</A>.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>10)
				Examine privacy policies and seals.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>When
				you are considering whether or not to do business with a Web
				site, there are other factors than a secure connection you have
				to consider that are equally important to Web security. Does the
				site provide offline contact information, including a postal
				address? Does the site have a prominently-posted privacy policy?
				If so, what does it say? (Just because they call it a &quot;privacy
				policy&quot; doesn't mean it will protect you - read it for
				yourself. Many are little more than disclaimers saying that you
				have no privacy! So read them carefully.) If the policy sounds OK
				to you, do you have a reason to believe it? Have you ever heard
				of this company? What is their reputation? And are they backing
				up their privacy statement with a seal program such as TRUSTe
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.truste.org/">http://www.truste.org/</A>&nbsp;)
				or BBBonline (&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.bbbonline.org/">http://www.bbbonline.org/</A>&nbsp;)?
				(While imperfect, such programs hold Web sites to at least some
				minimal baseline standards, and may revoke, with much fanfare,
				the approval-seal licenses of bad-acting companies that do not
				keep their word.) If you see a seal, is it real? Check with the
				seal-issuing site to make sure the seal isn't a fake. And examine
				terms carefully, especially if you are subscribing to a service
				rather than buying a product. Look out for auto-rebilling scams
				and hidden fees. </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>11)
				Remember that YOU decide what information about yourself to
				reveal, when, why, and to whom.</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Don't
				give out personally-identifiable information too easily. Just as
				you might think twice about giving some clerk at the mall your
				home address and phone number, keep in mind that simply because a
				site asks for or demands personal information from you does not
				mean you have to give it. You do have to give accurate billing
				information if you are buying something, of course, but if you
				are registering with a free site that is a little too nosy for
				you, there is no law (in most places) against providing them with
				pseudonymous information. (However, it would probably be polite
				to use obviously fake addresses, such as &quot;123 No Such
				Street, Nowhere, DC 01010&quot;. If they are generating mailings
				based on this information - presumably in accordance with the
				terms of their privacy policy - they can probably weed such
				addresses out and not waste the postage on them. Definitely do
				NOT use someone else's real address!) </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>12)
				Use encryption!</B> </FONT></FONT>
				</P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
				but certainly not least, there are other privacy threats besides
				abusive marketers, nosy bosses, spammers and scammers. Some of
				the threats include industrial espionage, government
				surveillance, identity theft, disgruntled former associates, and
				system crackers. Relatively easy-to-use e-mail and file
				encryption software is available for free, such as Pretty Good
				Privacy (PGP, available at: <A HREF="http://www.pgpi.org/">http://www.pgpi.org/</A>&nbsp;),
				which runs on almost all computers and even integrates seamlessly
				with most major e-mail software. Good encryption uses very robust
				secret codes, that are difficult if not impossible to crack, to
				protect your data. You can also use specialized services (some
				free, some pay) that go beyond infomediary services, including
				running all connections through a securely encrypted &quot;tunnel&quot;,
				anonymous dialup, even anonymous Web publishing. Anonymizer
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/affiliate/door.cgi?CMid=13763">http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/affiliate/door.cgi?CMid=13763</A>&nbsp;)
				offers all of these services. Another type of product is SSH
				tunnelling (port forwarding) packages, such as FSecure SSH
				(&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.fsecure.com/products/ssh/">http://www.fsecure.com/products/ssh/</A>&nbsp;),
				and SecureCRT (&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/index.html">http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/</A>&nbsp;).</FONT></FONT></TD>
