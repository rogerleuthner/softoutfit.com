Overview</b><br>
SMTP is the protocol by which Internet mail is sent. SMTP servers use
this protocol to communicate with other servers or mail clients.
However, by telneting directly to a mail server and manually speaking
SMTP, one can easily send mail from any address specified - meaning
that mail can be sent from fake addresses while the sender's real
address is untraceable.<br>
            <br>
            <b>RFC 821</b><br>
SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL (SMTP)<br>
Jonathan B. Postel<br>
August 1982<br>
The objective of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is to transfer
mail reliably and efficiently.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What do I need ?</b><br>
All that you need is a generic telnet client. Local echo should be
turned on so you can see what you type. Also, it is important to note
that SMTP servers do not handle backspaces, so you must type everything
correctly. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How do I Start?</b><br>
Telnet to port 25 of your target SMTP server (more on SMTP servers
selection below). The server should respond with a generic welcome
message. You will type HELO domain.name. Use any domain name you wish
as most servers do not check the name against the IP you are telneting
from. Type MAIL FROM: &lt;from@wherever.com&gt;. This is where the
message will appear to be from. Next, type RCPT TO:
&lt;to@wherever.com&gt;. This specifies who will receive the message.
Type DATA and type the body of your message. To send the message, enter
a line with only a period. Type QUIT to disconnect. <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <b>Note</b><br>
When the SMTP Server is using q-mail (find out by typing HELP when
connected) you have to type the charset and mime info:<br>
MIME-Version: 1.0<br>
Content-Type: text/plain;<br>
charset="iso-8859-1"<br>
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can my mail be traced?</b><br>
Yes, This is traceable by any sysadmin ... don't harass people this
way.
            <p>If the person receiving the mail uses a shell like elm
he/she will not see the telltale fake message warning
"Apparently-To:(name)" even if not, most people wouldn't know<br>
what it means anyway. Make sure you use a four part address
somebody@part1.pt2.pt3.pt4 so as to make it look more believable and
cover any add-ons the mail routine might try. Put a realistic mail
header in the mail message to throw people off even more. If there are
To: and Date: lines then the program probably won't add them on.</p>
            <p>Also try to telnet to the site where the recipient has
his account. This works better if you know how to fool it.</p>
            <b>What SMTP servers can I use?</b><br>
An easy (but hit-or-miss) way to find random SMTP servers is to look at
web addresses on Yahoo! or another search engine. Universities and
government agencies are always good choices. Find a URL and telnet to
port 25. If you get a response, you have located an available server.
95% of servers will accept your mail. The others will not allow
external mail forwarding for security reasons. Always test the server
first. <br>
            <p><b>What about message subjects?</b><br>
The subject, date, to, etc. are part of the DATA area. After the DATA
command, start with date and continue is the fashion illustrated by the
example code below. Make sure there are no mistakes, because the first
mistake will cause the data to appear in the body of the message, not
header. It is interesting, because these fields take precedence over
the MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: when displaying. A message can be routed to
a person even though the message itself appears to be addressed to
someone else. The key is to type VERY carefully.<br>
